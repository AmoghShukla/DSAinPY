'''
Given the binary representation of an integer as a string s, return the number of steps to reduce it to 1 under the following rules:
If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2.
If the current number is odd, you have to add 1 to it.
It is guaranteed that you can always reach one for all test cases.

Level : Medium

Input: s = "1101"
Output: 6
Explanation: "1101" corressponds to number 13 in their decimal representation.
Step 1) 13 is odd, add 1 and obtain 14. 
Step 2) 14 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 7.
Step 3) 7 is odd, add 1 and obtain 8.
Step 4) 8 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 4.  
Step 5) 4 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 2. 
Step 6) 2 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 1.
